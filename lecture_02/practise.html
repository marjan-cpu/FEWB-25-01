<h1>John Lennon Lyrics "Imagine"</h1>

<p>Imagine there's no heaven <br>
  It's easy if you try <br>
  No hell below us
  Above us only sky
  Imagine all the people
  Living for today... Aha-ah...</p>
  
  <p>Imagine there's no countries
  It isn't hard to do
  Nothing to kill or die for
  And no religion, too
  Imagine all the people
  Living life in peace... You... </p>
  
  <p>You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will be as one </p>
  
  <p>Imagine no possessions
  I wonder if you can
  No need for greed or hunger
  A brotherhood of man
  Imagine all the people
  Sharing all the world... You... </p>
  
  <p>You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will live as one</p>
<h1>Steve Jobs</h1>

  <blockquote>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.</blockquote>
