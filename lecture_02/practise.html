<h1>John Lennon Lyrics "Imagine"</h1>

<p>Imagine there's no heaven <br>
  It's easy if you try <br>
  No hell below us
  Above us only sky
  Imagine all the people
  Living for today... Aha-ah...</p>
  
  <p>Imagine there's no countries
  It isn't hard to do
  Nothing to kill or die for
  And no religion, too
  Imagine all the people
  Living life in peace... You... </p>
  
  <p>You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will be as one </p>
  
  <p>Imagine no possessions
  I wonder if you can
  No need for greed or hunger
  A brotherhood of man
  Imagine all the people
  Sharing all the world... You... </p>
  
  <p>You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
  I hope someday you'll join us
  And the world will live as one</p>
