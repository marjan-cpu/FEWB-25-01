        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Osijek, Croatia, I developed a passion for cooking early on while attending culinary college. I’ve always loved experimenting with different dishes and connecting with people through food. Beyond the kitchen, I have a deep appreciation for cinema, cultural events, and a strong interest in technology, science, and rockets. When it comes to music, I’m drawn to pop and chill beats.</p>
        <p>In 2014, I made the bold decision to move to Ireland, seeking new experiences and personal growth. This move opened doors to travel and connect with amazing people, making my journey even more enriching. Now, as I study web development, I’m eager to learn the skills needed to craft great digital experiences and continue evolving in this exciting field.</p>
